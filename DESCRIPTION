Description:
    Use this package to create or update AnVIL workspaces from
    resources such as R / Bioconductor packages. The metadata about
    the package (e.g., select information from the package DESCRIPTION
    file and from vignette YAML headings) are used to populate the
    'DASHBOARD'. Vignettes are translated to python notebooks ready
    for evaluation in AnVIL.
